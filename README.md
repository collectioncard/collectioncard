### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thomas, a Computational Media PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I've had the pleasure of working on some projects that I'm really proud of! Check out [Vera](https://github.com/Team-Creative-Name/Vera) and [Pizza with Gun](https://lifehckr.itch.io/pizza-with-gun), two of my latest projects!

You can also find more of my work on my [itch.io page](https://collectioncard.itch.io/).

Currently, I'm focused on updating my portfolio website to showcase my favorite projects. Stay tuned for the link!

Please feel free to [shoot me a message](mailto:turpleturtle12@gmail.com) if you find anything that I'm doing interesting to you! I love talking about projects and topics that interest me.
